## Core Concepts

### Information Theory-Driven Design

This platform treats lead generation as an **entropy reduction system**:

- **Entropy (H)**: Measure of uncertainty about a prospect
- **Information Gain (I)**: Reduction in uncertainty from each question
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Quality signal vs irrelevant noise
- **Compression**: Simplifying complex data while preserving meaning

### Intent-Based Offers

The system uses **intent classification** (buy/sell/browse) to filter applicable offers, which are **self-contained entities** that own their questions and generation logic.

See [Architecture: Intent-Based Offers](architecture/intent-based-offers.md) for details.
